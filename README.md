# Sparks!

A prototype for an oxidized version of Sparks, the Discord bot for indie TRPGs.

(she/her)

Sparks uses [serenity.rs]() to talk to Discord, and currently supports Forged in the Dark, Sparked by Resistance, Powered by the Apocalypse, and Wild Words rolls. Thanks to [River Ray](https://riverray.itch.io) for the original TypeScript implementation of Wild Words, on which Sparks' current Rust code is based.

(A brief note: the official help text asks users to report issues on Sparks' itch.io page. You're welcome to file them here as well, if you have a Github account; itch is given as the first point of contact only because most of Sparks' users are probably not programmers themselves.
